Everything you need to know about optimisation algorithms 

### What is optimisation?
Optimisation is the finding of the optima solution to any problem at hand.  Such problem could be maximisation or minimisation.  In another sense, it's basically finding the best combination of variables to optimise a certain problem. 

Types of optimisation problem:
- Continous problem
- Combinatorial Problem
