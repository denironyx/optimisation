# optimisation
Everything you need to know about optimisation algorithms and combinatorics

### What is optimisation?
Optimisation is the finding of the optima solution to any problem at hand.  Such problem could be maximisation or minimisation. 

Types of optimisation problem:
- Combinatorial Problem: A combinatorial optimization problem is the act of trying to find out the value (combination) of variables that optimizes (minimising or maximising) an index(value) from among many options under various constraints.
- Continuous Problem: Continuous optimization means finding the minimum or maximum value of a function of one or many real variables, subject to constraints.

Examples of combinatorial problem
- Traveling salesman Problem:As another example of the combinatorial optimization problem, let's think about the traveling salesman problem (delivery route problem).
This problem is a question of how the salesman should navigate for the shortest traveling route (optimal route) when visiting multiple cities when given a list of inter-city distances. A major caveat is that he will visit each city only once.

- Knapsack Problem: Everyone has experienced solving combinatorial optimization problems in various situations of everyday life. Let's recall, for example, a picnic snack selection when you were a child (Knapsack problem).

  In this case, variables, constraints, and values are:
  -  Variables: Snack you choose
  -  Constraints : Money in your pocket
  -  Indicator (value) : Total degree of satisfaction
- Vehicle Routing Problem:


Metaheuristics:
- Heuristics: a technique which seeks optimal or near-optimal solutions at a reasonable computational cost.

Metaheuristics are heuristics that are inspirted by nature and are not problem specific

The space of possible solutions is typically too large to search exhaustively using pure brute force. In some cases, problems can be solved exactly using Branch and Bound techniques. However, in other cases no exact algorithms are feasible, and randomized search algorithms must be employed, such as:
- Ant colony optimization
- Simulated annealing
- Genetic algorithms
- Tabu search
- Particle Swarm Optimisation

A large part of the field of Operations Research involves algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems
