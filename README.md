# optimisation
Everything you need to know about optimisation algorithms and combinatorics

### What is optimisation?
Optimisation is the finding of the optima solution to any problem at hand.  Such problem could be maximisation or minimisation. 

Types of optimisation problem:
- Combinatorial Problem: A combinatorial optimization problem is the act of trying to find out the value (combination) of variables that optimizes (minimising or maximising) an index(value) from among many options under various constraints.
- Continuous Problem: Continuous optimization means finding the minimum or maximum value of a function of one or many real variables, subject to constraints.

Examples of combinatorial problem
- Traveling salesman Problem:As another example of the combinatorial optimization problem, let's think about the traveling salesman problem (delivery route problem).
This problem is a question of how the salesman should navigate for the shortest traveling route (optimal route) when visiting multiple cities when given a list of inter-city distances. A major caveat is that he will visit each city only once.

- Knapsack Problem: Everyone has experienced solving combinatorial optimization problems in various situations of everyday life. Let's recall, for example, a picnic snack selection when you were a child (Knapsack problem).

  In this case, variables, constraints, and values are:
  -  Variables: Snack you choose
  -  Constraints : Money in your pocket
  -  Indicator (value) : Total degree of satisfaction
- Vehicle Routing Problem:
